A simple example is made to introduce the Node REPL environment.

It calculates the area of the circle based on the radius value entered from the command line.

After typing the **node** command, you must enter the name of the script in the first parameter and the radius of the circle in the second parameter.

You can use like this.

>`~$ node circleArea 10`
>
> `~$ The area of a circle with a radius of 10 is 314.16.`
